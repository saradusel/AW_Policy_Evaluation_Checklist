            The most advanced studies in the field, those that include a parameterised example, rely on hedonism (Espinosa and Treich 2024b, 2024c; Espinosa 2023; Kuruc and McFadden 2023b; Fischer 2023). The study by Rusman et al. (2023) is an exception as it provides a parameterised example without specifying the underlying concept of welfare.

            <br/><br/>

            Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) criticise hedonism for being “partly anthropocentric” (p.271) because mental states matter a lot to humans, but this may not be true for other species. Hence, if only mental states count for welfare, humans receive implicit priority over other species <i>(ibid.)</i>. On the contrary, Fischer (2022) argues that it would not make much of a difference to adopt an objective-good concept instead of hedonism because, even if other goods were included, hedonic goods (especially, freedom from pain) would be most important by far for all species. According to Fischer (2022), pain is such an intense experience that it cannot be outweighed by any other non-hedonic good. In particular, Fischer (2022) emphasises that individuals would not deliberately choose to undergo physical torture in order to obtain any other non-hedonic good. But this is not entirely convincing: First, there are examples of humans choosing almost certain torture by standing up against dictatorships to obtain goods like free press. Second, in the context of animals, Fischer’s own assumption that pain intensity likely differs between species makes it more plausible that other goods could be more important than pain for some species. This leads back to Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) who suggest to account for such differences between species by adopting the objective-good or preferentialist concept of welfare.

            <br/><br/>

            Espinosa and Treich (2024b) acknowledge the arguments against hedonism raised by Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021). In response, Espinosa and Treich (2024b) adopt a “hybrid approach mixing the hedonistic and objective list approach” (p.19). However, we do not consider this theoretically consistent because we take the welfare concepts as mutually exclusive. Instead, based on Visak (2022, p. 65), we would characterise their approach as hedonism, using resource-based technical indicators to infer hedonic welfare states.

            <br/><br/>

            In animal science, subjective experiences play an important role (Gaffney et al. 2023), according to Visak (2022, p.63) even a dominant role. Browning (2023) sees hedonism as the most common concept underlying research in animal science. For example, the influential Five Domains Framework by Mellor (2016) can be ascribed to hedonism (Browning 2023; Visak 2022, p. 64). In contrast, Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) consider the objective-good concept, including hedonic goods, as the standard concept in animal science. This controversy is not surprising, given that studies in animal science often do not define the underlying welfare concept (Visak 2022, p.65; Bruckner 2020). Instead, concepts are assigned from the outside perspective, leaving room for interpretation how animal welfare frameworks and indicators can be linked to the welfare concepts.

            Theoretical frameworks for preference-based non-anthropocentric CBA or SWF have been developed by Budolfson et al. (2024), Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021), Lusk and Norwood (2012), and Marggraf et al. (2012). These frameworks are rather basic and not yet connected to actual findings from animal science where animals’ preferences are tested experimentally (e.g., Ede et al. 2022).

            <br/><br/>

            Browning (2023) finds preference-based approaches “far less convincing for animals” (p.535) than for humans, mainly because she suspects self-harming preferences in animals that, unlike for humans (e.g., smoking), could not be accounted for by defining a set of idealised rational preferences. However, Browning (2023) does not provide convincing reasons why this should not be possible, she just posits that she cannot imagine idealised rational preferences could be defined for animals. Although Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) acknowledge the existence of problematic preferences in animals (as in humans), they consider it possible to account for them, only this work has not been done for animals yet.

            Visak (2022, p.21ff, 36ff) has critically reviewed the objective-good approaches by Kagan (2019) and McMahan (1996). She points out that these approaches may have very different implications, depending on whether goods are included that animals and humans can attain to the same extent (e.g., health), or not (e.g., playing the piano). In this context, Visak (2022, p.25) criticises the lack of commitment in the literature to any specific list of goods. Further, Visak (2022, p.71) criticises that many of the proposed goods are more plausibly instrumental for experiencing pleasure (i.e., for hedonism) than that they are ends in themselves.

            <br/><br/>

            Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) see the main advantage of the objective-good concept in its flexibility to account for differences between species (as compared to hedonism). The main challenge is the need to find weights for the different goods depending on how important they are for the different species (Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021; Schukraft 2020c). As a solution, Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) propose that weights should be informed by species’ own preferences over goods i.e., the animals decide themselves how to weigh the different goods.
            <br/>Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) consider the objective-good concept, including hedonic goods, as the standard concept in animal science, but this is controversial (see part 1.1). Lists of indicators, as they are common in research on animal science, are easily assigned to the objective-good concept, although they may also be instrumental for welfare in the other concepts (Visak 2022, p.65). The animal welfare frameworks about natural living and biological functioning (Appleby and Sandøe 2002), and also the WOAH definition of animal welfare and the Five Freedoms Framework (Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021) have been linked to the objective-good concept of welfare.

    <tr>
        <td>
            Presuming <b>hedonism</b>, differences in the capacity for welfare between species are often justified with the biological underpinnings of pleasure and suffering (Budolfson et al. 2024; Espinosa and Treich 2024b, 2024c; Espinosa 2023; Fischer 2023; Gaffney et al. 2023; Schukraft 2020b; Budolfson and Spears 2020). For example, Fischer (2023) and Schukraft (2020b) claim that different cognitive and/or emotional capacities of the species (e.g., capacity for mental time travel or romantic love) may be positively or negatively correlated with the capacity for welfare. In a large project, Fischer (2023) investigates one-by-one which cognitive and emotional capacities are present or absent in different species, and derives hedonic welfare capacities from this. Fischer’s approach can be criticised for missing the point that different specialisations of species may mean that the presence or absence of capacities would not have the same relevance across species (Visak 2022, p.28; Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021). For example, it does not seem plausible that solitary animals suffer because they do not engage in social behaviours like romantic love (Visak 2022, p.28; Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021). In turn, from the perspective of a dog, the underdeveloped olfactory capacities of humans could be seen as a deficit reducing welfare capacity (Visak 2022, p.52). This makes Fischer’s focus on cognitive and emotional capacities, in which humans are particularly specialised, appear arbitrary (Visak 2022, p.49). Fischer (2023) himself admits that his approach might rather map the variety of hedonic states than their intensity, and he leaves this for further research.

            <br/><br/>

            A much simpler approach, relying only on the number of cortical neurons to estimate welfare capacities, is adopted by Espinosa and Treich (2024b), Espinosa and Treich (2024c), Espinosa (2023), Rusman et al. (2023), and Budolfson and Spears (2020). Neuron counts as a proxy are generally compatible with all welfare concepts, but they feature most prominently in connection with hedonism (Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021), for example in the study by Espinosa and Treich (2024b). Using neuron counts to infer welfare capacity is strongly criticised as too simplistic (reviewed by Shriver 2022), and even those who apply it, acknowledge major deficits.

            <br/><br/>

            The <b>objective-good concept</b> is generally considered compatible with different capacities for welfare (e.g., Fischer 2022; Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021; Schukraft 2020a), but Visak (2022, p.25) points out that, depending on the types of goods included, equal capacities would also be compatible (see also 1.1). It is less clear whether <b>preferentialism</b> is compatible with different capacities for welfare. Visak (2022, p.30, 48) argues that preferentialism must imply equal capacities for welfare because having one’s preferences satisfied means the same thing across species, only the content of preferences may differ which she finds irrelevant at this point. In contrast, Schukraft (2020a) takes preferentialism as compatible with different welfare capacities because he hypothesises that strength, number, and complexity of preferences differ across species though empirical research on this is lacking to date.

            <br/><br/>

            If different welfare capacities are assumed, it is possible to either <b>normalise</b> measured welfare to the species-specific minimum and maximum levels, <b>or to compare absolute values</b> across species. In the literature, different terminology exists to describe normalisation: Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) call it the “maximum principle” (p.279), Gaffney et al. (2023) describe it as “species-relativized welfare impacts” (p.5), and Browning (2023) refers to normalisation as the “[s]imilarity in capacity assumption” (p.537). The latter wording seems to be counterintuitive but it encapsulates what Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021) criticise about normalisation: normalisation wipes out differences between species because, even if absolute welfare levels differ vastly, two individuals may still be considered equally well-off if species-normalised values are used for comparison. Visak (2022, p.36ff) and Horta (2010) review specific methods for normalisation that differ with regards to which minimum and maximum values exactly are used (e.g., McMahan’s (1996) native potential account). If these minimum and maximum values are chosen in a way that cements the status quo, normalisation can be considered anthropocentric because the suffering of other species is easier to ignore if it is presented in normalised terms (Fleurbaey and Leppanen 2021). Consider for example dairy cows: If the minimum and maximum values for normalisation are derived from the welfare capacities of current high-yielding breeds, the need for more robust breeds may seem less urgent because current welfare levels appear less concerning in relative terms.

    <tr>
        <td>
            Presuming <b>hedonism</b>, Browning (2023) and Visak (2022, p.87) consider equal capacities as the main view in animal science because pleasure and suffering emerged from shared evolutionary pressures as a means to modulate behaviour, and are grounded in similar structures across species. Others consider hedonism compatible with different capacities for welfare, based on alternative lines of biological reasoning (see 1.2).

            <br/><br/>

            For <b>preferentialism</b>, Visak (2022, p.30, 48) argues on a conceptual level that this must be connected to equal capacities because welfare is determined solely by whether preferences are fulfilled, which has the same meaning across species – but this view is challenged (see 1.2).

            <br/><br/>

            For the <b>objective-good concept</b> of welfare, Visak (2022, p.25) points out that certain goods (e.g., physical health) may be attained by animals and humans to the same extent, which would imply equal capacities. However, with other goods, the objective-good concept of welfare is also compatible with different capacities for welfare (see 1.2).

            Eichner and Runkel (2022) use the inverse of the stocking density, approximated by land input per animal, as the animal welfare indicator for their General Equilibrium Model. Of note, this indicator does not relate to the actual space provided to the animals but includes land input for feed production.

            <br/><br/>

            In contrast, based on the methodology proposed by Scherer et al. (2018), Rusman et al. (2023) use i) stocking densities in the sense of space provided to the animals for broilers, laying hens, and pigs, ii) number of days on pasture for cattle, and ii) transport time for all four species, as animal welfare indicators.

            <br/><br/>

            The studies by Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c), and Espinosa (2023) are based on the Five Freedoms Framework. For different husbandry systems, violations of the five freedoms are assessed by experts, and serve as indicators of animal welfare.

Other than that, the classical animal-based indicators (e.g., lameness) have not yet been introduced into the economic frameworks for non-anthropocentric CBA and  SWF. This is a severe drawback. Yet, in theory, all approaches would be compatible with animal-based indicators, just this has not been done yet. Of note, the complex indicator list by Fischer (2023) serves to estimate welfare capacities, not actual welfare at a specific point in time. Welfare capacities could be combined with resource-, management- or animal-based indicators to assess actual welfare.

            The measurement scale is restricted to negative values in the studies by Eichner and Runkel (2022) and Kuruc and McFadden (2023b). Both studies give similar reasons: i) because the authors find it reasonable to assume that the welfare of farmed animals is generally negative, and ii) to avoid the undesirable consequence of their approaches that animal production would have to be increased if animal welfare was positive.

            <br/><br/>

            In contrast, Rusman et al. (2023) restrict the scale to non-negative values (i.e., zero or positive values) for ethical reasons, assuming that loss of life is generally not in the animals’ interest. This is based on the methodology proposed by Scherer et al. (2018).

            It is passionately debated whether differences between the species should be accounted for in the measurement steps and/or whether additional weights should be used during aggregation (Visak 2022, p.123ff; Schukraft 2020a; Kagan 2019, p.54; Horta 2018, 2017, 2010). An important limitation of the reviewed literature is that none of the studies actually measure welfare across species, although methods have been proposed by Browning (2023) and Gaffney et al. (2023). Instead, at best, expert assessments as in Espinosa and Treich (2024b) are used to assess welfare states. Hence, to date, the parameterised studies in the field, except Kuruc and McFadden (2023b), rely on additional weights to depict differences between species.

            Weights based on the same empirical reasoning as for welfare capacities (section 1.2) are applied by Budolfson et al. (2024), Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c), and Espinosa (2023). In fact, in these studies, the same weights are used twice: First, to infer differences in welfare capacities between species. Then, welfare levels are normalised to the different capacities, which wipes out any differences between species (section 1.2). But because the authors want to hold on to these differences, they apply the same weights again in the aggregation step. Due to the normalisation, this does not correspond to the double-discounting that Schukraft (2020a) warns of, but the ‘back-and-forth’ should be addressed more explicitly in such cases.

            <br/><br/>

            In the study by Rusman et al. (2023), a discounting factor is applied in the calculations but it is unclear whether this reflects differences in welfare capacities, an aggregation weight, or different marginal utilities of money (see sections 1.2 and 3.1).

            <br/><br/>

            An important criticism of applying weights during aggregation is that these weights can overrule anything from the previous steps, which means that equal interests of individuals from different species may not receive equal consideration (e.g., Schukraft 2020a; Kagan 2019, p.108; Horta 2018, 2017, 2016). Espinosa and Treich (2024b) realise this themselves and are dissatisfied that the same pain would be valued differently in their approach, depending on whether it is experienced by a pig or a human. They propose to apply equal weights to equal interests, but this is only a workaround to a problem that arises from the lack of actual welfare measurement, from the normalisation and the weighing in their approach (section 1.2).

            <br/><br/>

            In contrast, Kagan (2019, p.55) does not find the hierarchical view on moral status problematic. He accepts that equal interests receive different weight depending on which species these interests belong to, and gives a striking example: If a mouse and a human are drowning (i.e., same interest at stake – survival), it would be very counterintuitive to flip a coin to decide who should be saved. Further, following from the concept of status-adjusted welfare (Schukraft 2020a; Kagan 2019, p. 108, see section 2.1), it would anyway lead to the same results if the same empirical reasoning serves to infer either weights for aggregation, or different welfare capacities in the measurement steps. Along the same lines, Blackorby and Donaldson (1992) point out that assigning different weights to the species is mathematically the same as assuming different utility functions of the species in the measurement steps.

            Several studies feature an additional weight to reflect the level of anthropocentrism in society i.e., humans’ attitudes towards protecting animals in general. Such a weight could be determined based on ethical deliberation, including for example, public surveys1. It can be applied in addition to weights based on empirical reasoning.

            <br/><br/>

            According to the societal values reflected in current laws, animals generally have a lower weight than humans, otherwise they could not be used for food production (Francione 2010). Food production has been connected to the issue of assigning weights also in other studies. Sebo (2022, p.157f) notes that human self-care could justify giving somewhat lower priority to animals because humans need to sustain their own species first, before they can protect other species. In an expert survey by Bracke et al. (2023), some respondents indicate that the weights on animal lives should depend on whether animals are kept for reasons of healthy nutrition (lower weight), or for excessive consumption (higher weight to prevent overconsumption).

            <br/><br/>

            Schukraft (2020c) has reviewed several survey studies and comes to the tentative conclusion that the hierarchical view is common, i.e. many people assign lower weights to animals than to humans, and weights are differentiated by animal species. Two additional surveys by Johansson-Stenman (2018) and Lusk and Norwood (2008) are not covered in Schukraft’s (2020c) review. Johansson-Stenman (2018) asked 1072 Swedish citizens in a representative survey about the weight animal suffering should have in public decisions. Respondents believe animal suffering, compared to human suffering, should count: equally (49.3%), less (43.5%), more (3.2%), only via human altruism (3.2%), should not count at all (0.8%). Lusk and Norwood (2008) conducted telephone interviews with 651 US citizens in a non-representative sample. On average, respondents equate the suffering of one human to the suffering of 8489 to 14310 farm animals. Of note, when the public are asked about the weights to be placed on animals, it is not entirely clear whether respondents take these weights as merely ethical, whether they derive them from empirical reasoning, or whether they do not even see them as weights in the sense of this review but rather as differences in welfare capacities (Schukraft 2020c; Johansson-Stenman 2018).

            <br/><br/>

            Further, the study by Clarke and Ng (2006) makes clear that weights need to be determined not only for the present, but also for future generations of animals and humans. However, the (dis)counting of future generations of animals does not play a role in the literature yet.

            <br/><br/>

            Lastly, weights based on ethical deliberation can serve as a ‘last resort’ in policy evaluations when empirical information is not available (Browning 2023).

            Utilitarianism is about maximising the overall quantity of welfare in society, and there are different ways how this quantity can be calculated. Utilitarian aggregation rules are currently the most frequently used in the field. Of note, cost-benefit analysis with distributional weights can be considered an approximation of various utilitarian (and other) SWFs (Adler 2019, p.37).

            <br/><br/>

            In <b>total utilitarianism</b>, the most basic form of utilitarianism, the sum of individual welfare is maximised. An undesirable consequence of total utilitarianism is the so-called ‘Repugnant Conclusion’, first described by Parfit (1984) and often cited in connection with animal welfare (e.g., Espinosa and Treich 2024c; Visak 2022, p.133; Bruers 2022). The Repugnant Conclusion denounces that numbers beat quality in total utilitarianism i.e., that a huge population with individuals of very poor welfare would be preferable compared to a population with fewer individuals of higher welfare.

            <br/><br/>

            This is mitigated in <b>average utilitarianism</b>, where the mean of individual welfare is maximised. However, this version of utilitarianism also has important deficits, in particular the so-called ‘Sadistic Conclusion’, first described by Arrhenius (2000) and also often cited in connection with animal welfare (e.g., Bruers 2022; Zuber et al. 2022). The Sadistic Conclusion entails that, when average welfare is sufficiently high in a population, it would be preferable to add few individuals with negative welfare than many individuals with positive, but below-average, welfare.

            <br/><br/>

            In <b>critical-level utilitarianism</b>, individual welfare is first subtracted by a constant, positive threshold value and then, the sum of the remainders is maximised. Critical-level utilitarianism also leads to the Sadistic Conclusion (Arrhenius 2000) but Bruers (2022) offers refined versions, called ‘neutral-range utilitarianism’ and ‘variable critical-level utilitarianism’, to avoid this. Essentially, this works by excluding contingent individuals i.e., those who do not exist in all scenarios (Bruers 2022). The approach is similar to the ‘prior-existence utilitarianism’ defended by Visak (2016, 2011), where only those individuals count that either already exist or will exist independently of the policy choice under consideration. Besides, a number of refined aggregation rules (not only utilitarian) have been proposed by Zuber et al. (2022).

            <br/><br/>

            Of course, the refined approaches also have their own problems, but this goes beyond the scope of the review and details can be found in the respective studies. The further refinement of utilitarian aggregation rules is a continuous process, and the novel approaches still take time to be taken up in parameterised studies.

            Prioritarianism and egalitarianism are aggregation rules that take into account the distribution of well-being in society. Although they feature differences with regards to the degree of priority given to the worse-off (see 2.2), prioritarianism and egalitarianism often require the same actions to be taken (Horta 2016; Faria 2014). Both aggregation rules are discussed together because their standing in the literature is similar.

            <br/><br/>

            Prioritarianism and egalitarianism are currently only discussed on a rather general level in the field. Espinosa and Treich (2024c) briefly introduce a general framework of equations for prioritarianism but find it too challenging to parameterise at this stage, given strong normative choices that would have to be made. Fleurbaey and van der Linden (2021) formalise egalitarianism in the context of an anthropocentric SWF, taking animal welfare into account only through human altruism. The most detailed, though qualitative, explorations of non-anthropocentric prioritarianism and egalitarianism can be found in the studies by Horta (2016) and Faria (2014). Both conclude that prioritarianism and egalitarianism would entail giving priority to animals because they are usually worse off compared to humans. This would require, for instance, veganism and a considerable shift of resources towards animals (Horta 2016; Faria 2014).

            <br/><br/>

            However, the circumstances under which animals can be considered worse-off compared to humans depend on the assumptions made in the previous steps, especially, on welfare capacities, normalisation, and weighing. As described by Horta (2016) and Faria (2014), a hierarchical weighing approach based on welfare capacity is proposed by Vallentyne (2005) to prevent excessive resource shifts towards animals in the egalitarian setting. Leaving aside the issue that Vallentyne’s approach entails double-discounting (Schukraft 2020a; see section 2.1), Faria (2014) considers hierarchical weighing generally incompatible with egalitarianism. Horta (2016) is not so apodictic and merely stresses that welfare capacity should be all that matters in welfare economics. As Vallentyne’s (2005) weighing is based on welfare capacity, it could be considered compatible with egalitarianism if it is combined with a normalisation approach to avoid double-discounting, and subsequent multiplication to produce status-adjusted welfare (see section 2.1).

            This assumption entails either an impersonal view on societal welfare where just the abstract quantity of welfare counts and different individuals can replace each other, or it entails comparing individual welfare with non-existence (Visak 2011, p.226, 236). Both situations are contested because either individual identity does not count, or because individual welfare is compared to a state in which the individual simply does not have welfare because it does not exist (e.g., Holtug 2016; Visak 2016). In particular, there is strong criticism against setting the neutral welfare state (see section 1.4) equal to non-existence as practiced by Kuruc and McFadden (2023b), or equal to non-existence and death as practiced by Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c). This is because the neutral welfare state is something the individual can actually experience while non-existence is not (Visak 2016), and death is again different because the individual existed before and ending its life will affect its welfare. Besides, as Treich (2022) acknowledges, it has been suggested by Ng (1995) that individuals feel neutral most of the time because positive and negative welfare states have high energy costs. Under this premises, life would be equal to non-existence or death most of the time, which seems counterintuitive.

            <br/><br/>

            When it comes to removing animals from the population under different policy options, it is generally distinguished between preventing to bring them into existence, or killing them (e.g., Visak 2011, p.230f; Blackorby and Donaldson 1992). Killing entails possible suffering due to a painful killing method, and/or the ‘harm of death’ which refers to the future welfare loss of the animals (Visak 2022, p.89). The extent to which animals experience harm of death is controversially disputed and relates, for example, to the species’ degree of connectedness to their future in terms of future plans and desires (e.g., Bradley 2016; Belshaw 2016, and reviewed by Visak 2022, p.88ff and Schukraft 2020a).

            <br/><br/>

            In total utilitarianism, as adopted by Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c) and Kuruc and McFadden (2023b), animals with negative welfare should not be brought into existence, or should be killed, while animals with positive welfare should be added and may be killed if replaced by other animals with positive welfare to compensate for the welfare loss (Visak 2011, p.227). Critical-level utilitarianism arrives at the same results as total utilitarianism if the critical threshold corresponds to the neutral welfare state (Kuruc and McFadden 2023b; Espinosa and Treich 2024b, 2024c). However, if the critical threshold lies above neutrality, there will be animals with positive welfare whose lives are worth living but who do not increase societal welfare (Espinosa and Treich 2024c; Blackorby and Donaldson 1991). In this case, if societal welfare is assessed separately for the situations with and without these animals, it would be required to either prevent the animals with positive but below-threshold welfare to be brought into existence, or to kill them without replacement (Blackorby and Donaldson 1991). In contrast, if societal welfare is assessed across both situations in a before-and-after setting, the individual welfare loss of the animals would be captured and it would only be required to prevent the animals from being born, but not to kill them <i>(ibid.)</i>. In either case, it may seem troublesome to deprive individuals who would subjectively have a life worth living from being born, or even to kill them, just because they do not increase societal welfare (Holtug 2016; Visak 2016; Blackorby and Donaldson 1991). The same results as for critical-level utilitarianism also hold for average utilitarianism, relating everything to the average instead of the critical threshold (Blackorby and Donaldson 1991).

            <br/><br/>

            In their studies, Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c) and Kuruc and McFadden (2023b) only focus on farm animals with a negative lifetime welfare and hence, a life not worth living. From their total utilitarian framework, they conclude that the number of these animals should be reduced in order to increase societal welfare. However, if the political goal is to provide farm animals a life with positive welfare (i.e., a life worth living), the opposite holds. Then, animal numbers would have to be increased (Kuruc and McFadden 2023b), and animal farming would have to be subsidised (Espinosa and Treich 2024b, 2024c). This constellation is known, and criticised (see 2.3), as the ‘logic of the larder’ (e.g., Espinosa and Treich 2024b, 2024c; Visak and Garner 2016; Visak 2011). Kuruc and McFadden (2023b) try to somehow avoid these implications by writing that they find their framework less useful for the case of positive welfare in animal farming. Espinosa and Treich (2024c) briefly mention that critical-level utilitarianism could be a way to avoid producing farm animals with positive but below-threshold welfare, so that only farming with positive above-threshold welfare would be subsidised. Generally, the higher the critical threshold, the more difficult to increase societal welfare merely by adding animals, instead of improving their welfare levels (Blackorby and Donaldson 1992). Yet, as explained above, critical-level utilitarianism comes at the expense of other undesirable implications.

            This assumption is in line with the person-affecting view where comparisons with non-existence are not possible, and individuals cannot replace each other (e.g., Visak 2022, p.104). Hence, the logic of the larder (i.e., animal farming has to be expanded if animals have positive welfare) is avoided under this assumption (Bruers 2022; Visak 2016).

            <br/><br/>

            Different refinements of person-affecting approaches have been proposed in the literature, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. These include, for example, ‘prior-existence utilitarianism’ (e.g., Visak 2016, 2011; see section 2.2), ‘neutral-range utilitarianism’, ‘variable critical-level utilitarianism’ (Bruers 2022; see section 2.2), and ‘saturating-counterpart person-affecting utilitarianism’ (Visak 2016). The latter maps individuals that exclusively exist in one of the scenarios to counterpart individuals in other scenarios (Visak 2016). Thereby, in certain desirable instances, the same conclusions are reached as with impersonal approaches, but the logic of the larder and other undesirable consequences are avoided <i>(ibid.)</i>.

            <br/><br/>

            As for assumption 2.3, death and killing affect the welfare of individuals in the person-affecting view. It constitutes a welfare loss if animals are deprived of positive experiences because their lives end prematurely. There are several methods to account for this welfare loss. These include, for example, calculations in analogy to human disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) where premature death and years of suffering are combined in a single measure (e.g., Minetto Gellert Paris et al. 2024 and 2022 based on Scherer et al. 2018; Weathers et al. 2020; Teng et al. 2018). Further, critical-level utilitarianism based on lifetime welfare penalises early slaughter because older animals accumulate positive welfare and exceed the critical threshold more easily (Blackorby and Donaldson 1992).

            <br/><br/>

            In the opposite case, when animals face negative welfare, the person-affecting approaches neither recommend to prevent these individuals from being brought into existence, nor to do the opposite, because comparisons with non-existence are just not possible (Visak 2016). However, once the animals do exist, it can be required to kill them also under the person-affecting view in order to increase societal welfare <i>(ibid.)</i>. Yet, as mentioned in section 2.3, situations where animals incur negative welfare should be prevented in the first place rather than only taking a reactive stance (see also Visak and Garner 2016, p.12).

            For some aggregation rules, the circle of individuals whose welfare counts is restricted. For example, some of the aggregation rules proposed by Visak (2016, 2011) and Bruers (2022) exclude individuals that do not exist in all policy scenarios (see section 2.2).

            <br/><br/>

            Other than that, the use of constraints is rarely discussed in the context of non-anthropocentric policy evaluations. Kuruc and McFadden (2023b) briefly mention that a ban on killing animals could be modelled in their approach as an additional cost, similar to a financial sanction for violations of the ban. Further, Bruers (2022) restricts the choice options available to individuals in order to avoid undesirable consequences like the Repugnant Conclusion.

            The main reason raised in the literature against the inclusion of human altruism is that this would result in the double-counting of animals’ interests (Espinosa and Treich 2023; Eichner and Runkel 2022; Marggraf et al. 2012; Lusk and Norwood 2012). Further, because human altruism is coupled to the animals’ own welfare (i.e., altruistic welfare decreases if animal welfare decreases), the double-counting may lead to the undesirable situation that welfare gains for animals cannot be redistributed to humans without decreasing total societal welfare (Lusk and Norwood 2012; Marggraf et al. 2012). Lusk and Norwood (2012) conclude from this that human altruism should not be included in addition to animal welfare when determining whether a policy increases total welfare, or when assessing compensatory redistributions. In contrast, Marggraf et al. (2012) consider it a viable option to include human altruism because they do not think it is necessary that redistributions have to be possible without decreasing total welfare. Marggraf et al. (2012) only stress that it should be carefully assessed which redistributions from animals to humans actually happen in practice in order not to overestimate the positive impacts of animal welfare policies.

            The main reasons to include human altruism in addition to animal welfare are i) that an important part of human welfare would simply be left out otherwise (Lusk and Norwood 2012; Marggraf et al. 2012), and ii) that human altruism can be considered as a new, separate welfare entity that should be included next to the animals’ own animal welfare (Eichner and Runkel 2022 based on Ng 1999).

            <br/><br/>

            When including human altruism in addition to animal welfare, it can be distinguished between pure and impure altruism. Pure altruism can be defined as an exact representation of the animals’ own welfare, mathematically expressed using the same term twice, with or without an additional weight to discount this term (Espinosa and Treich 2024c, 2021; Marggraf et al. 2012). In contrast, impure altruism can be defined as a distorted misrepresentation of animal welfare where humans misunderstand what animals actually need (Espinosa 2023; Marggraf et al. 2012).

            <br/><br/>

            Multiple studies feature the option to include pure altruism in addition to animal welfare, with or without weight, but do not take sides whether this would be desirable. Johansson-Stenman (2018) and Marggraf et al. (2012) provide general frameworks that would be compatible with pure or impure altruism. The most elaborate framework to date for human altruism in non-anthropocentric policy evaluations has been developed by Eichner and Runkel (2022). The authors model human altruism as a combination of <i>homo oeconomicus</i>, taking the level of animal welfare as exogenously given because individual food purchases are perceived as having negligible impacts on animal welfare, and of <i>homo kantiensis</i>, making every food purchase according to what is the right thing to do and assuming that everybody was doing the same <i>(ibid.)</i>. The framework by Eichner and Runkel (2022) can be categorised as pure altruism, with an additional weight.

            There is a large body of literature on the monetary value humans assign to one year of life in perfect health (QALY), or to avoiding the loss of one year of life due to death, illness or disability (DALY). These monetary values are based on humans’ stated or revealed willingness to pay (reviewed by e.g., Stawasz 2020; Ryen and Svensson 2015; OECD 2012).

            <br/><br/>

            For animals, the human QALY and DALY values are discounted, either based on the reasoning that animals have lower capacity for welfare, lower weight in society compared to humans, and/or a lower utility of money.

            <br/><br/>

            Because the monetary values for animals are directly derived from human values of QALYs and DALYs, the approach entails some level of anthropocentrism (Stawasz 2020).

            <br/><br/>

            Table 1 provides examples of monetary values from two parameterised studies using QALYs and DALYs as the basis for monetisation.

            The international poverty line of $1.90/day serves as the basis for monetisation only in the study by Kuruc and McFadden (2023b). In this study, it is assumed that the welfare of one farm animal is equivalent to the welfare of one human living on $1.00/day i.e., below the international poverty line. Kuruc and McFadden (2023b) themselves note that this assumption is rather arbitrary and they see it more as a proof of principle, with the possibility to further differentiate between farmed species, farm types etc. in the future.

            <br/><br/>

            As for QALYs and DALYs, the human poverty line as a reference point implies some level of anthropocentrism because the value of $1.00/day is arbitrarily chosen without input from animals, using a poverty scale that is determined entirely by human action on global markets.
            Table 1 provides an example of a monetary value from the study by Kuruc and McFadden (2023b).

            When a preferentialist concept of welfare is adopted, the marginal welfare increase of animals can be inferred from the quantity of feed they are willing to forego in order to obtain certain resources. To monetise this welfare increase, the quantity of feed can be multiplied by the market price of feed (Lusk and Norwood 2012; Marggraf et al. 2012)1. The approach would also work with other proxies instead of feed that are used in analogy to money to determine the strength of animal preferences (Lusk and Norwood 2012; Marggraf et al. 2012). For example, drawing from the study by Eichner and Runkel (2022), land prices would be an option if animals’ preferences could be measured in the amount of land they are willing to give up for different resources.

            <br/><br/>

            The main advantage of the approach is that it uses animals’ actual preferences and their marginal rates of substitution between goods to inform monetisation. However, only humans interact on markets and determine market prices. Hence, unless a “liquid interspecies market” (Keeler 2016, p.721) can be put in place, monetisation based on market prices will entail some level of anthropocentrism.

            <br/><br/>

            To date, this monetisation approach has not been adopted in a parameterised example.

            Lusk and Norwood (2012) believe that the marginal utility of money is higher for animals than for humans because they consider it plausible that, for example, an additional $100 represents a small welfare increase for a middle-class human but a large welfare increase for a pig.

            <br/><br/>

            Kuruc and McFadden (2023b) place animals on the steep, and humans on the flat, segment of the same utility function of income, meaning animals have a higher marginal utility of money compared to humans. This also implies that animals could reach the same welfare level as humans if they received enough money.

            <br/><br/>

            As described in section 2.1, weights are used in the studies by Budolfson et al. (2024), Espinosa and Treich (2024b, 2024c), and Espinosa (2023). These weights also discount the value of money for the different species because of the way they are included in the multiplication formula, resulting in a higher marginal utility of money for animals compared to humans. However, the authors do not comment on this and hence, it remains unclear whether it is actually intended that the same figures as for welfare capacities and aggregation weights simultaneously also determine utility of money.

            <br/><br/>

            Similarly, Rusman et al. (2023) use a “morally adjusted monetisation factor of a (human) DALY” (<i>ibid.</i>, p.65) to convert welfare units into monetary units, resulting in a larger utility of money for animals compared to humans, but they do not specify whether this is actually intended or rather reflects different welfare capacities and/or aggregation weights.

            Johansson-Stenman (2018) assumes for simplicity that animal welfare is converted into monetary units with the same marginal utility of money as human welfare (also the same across human individuals).

            <br/><br/>

            Marggraf et al. (2012) and Blackorby and Donaldson (1992) do not explicitly address marginal utility of money but from their formulas it becomes clear that they assume the same marginal utility of money across and within species.

            <br/><br/>

            Lusk and Norwood (2012) are more in favour of different marginal utilities of money but for Kaldor-Hicks transfers between species to be possible, they have to assume the same marginal utility of money across and within species.

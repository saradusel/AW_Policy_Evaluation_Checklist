<h1>Checklist for Animal Welfare in Policy Evaluations</h1>

<p>The checklist covers the non-anthropocentric monetisation in CBA, and inclusion in SWF, of impacts on animals. It is based on a critical literature review.</p>

<p>This version: 9 July 2024</p>

<p>At this stage, the checklist only covers key findings of the critical literature review. Further details will be added over the next weeks. So, stay tuned!</p>

<p>A working paper is forthcoming and will be available under: <a href="http://opus.uni-hohenheim.de/schriftenreihen_ebene2.php?sr_id=2&la=de">http://opus.uni-hohenheim.de/schriftenreihen_ebene2.php?sr_id=2&la=de</a></p>

She points out that these approaches may have very different implications depending on whether goods are included that animals and humans can attain to the same extent (e.g., health), or not (e.g., playing the piano). <br/>In this context, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/capacity-for-welfare-across-species-9780192882202?cc=de&lang=en&">Višak (2022)</a> criticises the lack of commitment in the literature to any specific list of goods. <br/>Further, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/capacity-for-welfare-across-species-9780192882202?cc=de&lang=en&">Višak (2022)</a> criticises that many of the proposed goods are more plausibly instrumental for experiencing pleasure (i.e., for hedonism) than that they are ends in themselves.
            <br/><br/><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10818-021-09315-x">Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021)</a> see the main advantage of the objective-good concept in its flexibility to account for differences between species (as compared to hedonism). They propose to apply weights to the goods depending on how important these are for different species. In their view, such weights should be informed by species’ preferences. In turn, rather than using preference-based weights for the objective-good concept, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10818-021-09315-x">Fleurbaey and Leppanen (2021)</a> suggest to adopt preferentialism altogether.
        <br/><br/><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8489.12560">Espinosa and Treich (2024a)</a> adopt a “hybrid approach mixing the hedonistic and objective list approach” (p.19). However, we do not consider this theoretically consistent because we take the welfare concepts as mutually exclusive. Instead, based on <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/capacity-for-welfare-across-species-9780192882202?cc=de&lang=en&">Višak (2022)</a>, we would characterise their approach as hedonism, using resource-based technical indicators to infer hedonic welfare states.</td>
